# Chess


## Install

### Clone the repository

```shell 
git clone git@github.com:kikicat-meows/chess.git
cd chess 
```

### Check your Ruby version

```shell
ruby -v
```

The output should start with something like `ruby 2.5.1`

If not, install the right ruby version using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):

```shell
rbenv install 2.5.1
```

### Playing the Game

To play the game, navigate to the chess folder in your terminal and type the following command:

```shell
ruby game.rb
```

Use the arrow keys to move around the board, and the spacebar to select a piece (or place it).

That's it. Enjoy!
